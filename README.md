# Mini project 2
*The objective of this assignment was to provide us with experience in analysis and design of database applications that could benefit from NoSQL databases. Our task was to select two or more databases of different NoSQL types, and compare their features and performance in storing, scaling, providing and processing big data.*

# Preparing the data

# Selecting the database operations

# Comparison criteria
 To compare the 2 NoSQL databases we've chosen, we decided to run different benchmarks on them, primarily comparing time spent to complete a given task.  
 
 We'll be looking into the following:
 * Inserting data. (In our case, 300.000+ items at one time.)
 * Retrieving data.
## Neo4j

### Benchmarks

#### Import/Insert
308000 Lines - 144.15 seconds (2 Minutes and 24 seconds)

## Redis
### Benchmarks

#### Import/Insert
308000 Lines - 3.65 seconds

#### Retrieve/Get
